# I, Game & Robot

## Create its background, theme, narrative framework, concept, characters, plots, etc.

### Background
The year 2022 in a random, nicely-cloudly agglomeration. The upcoming changes can be felt in the air. And the robo-vehicle you joined the party to be tested in real challenges. 

### Theme

It’s a subject, an intended experience for the players.

Fully digital, AI-driven world of the future has their challenges to achieve in advance and you help to make a smooth co-existance between robots, people and robo-vehicles possible. But you’re invited to be the creator of it, as a new world won’t happen without your engagement. Players are invited to make familiar with challenges of the digital world and feel their creative potential so they can evolve from being consumer to be the creator. 

### Narrative Framework

Digital, AI-driven cities of the future won’t happen without your engegament. You’re the creator who builds it step by step no matter of the obstacles you have to overcome once you made your potential free, and you really take the challenge of be the creator instead of only a customer. So understand the challenges first, solve them step by step, and see the real creator in you. Also you would keep all your created. 
The game must be broken into scenes, and each of this scene could be a puzzle, an enemy encounter and so on, with a requirement so not to be repeat many times so a lot of logic and gameplay has to be coded into the world.



### Concept

Building a fully digital future city when robots and people live together and AI make all things much easier. Enagage a player enough so they feel like a real co-creators of the future world which can also make a toll of their efforts in the reality. Help people to understand what are the challenges of the full digitalization so what problems needs to be solved in a easy and understandable way, but also present them with the prizes it carries. Make them understand that :
1) it’s not happening on their own, but it requires the engagement and a feedback,
2) as people they has to evaluate from being only a consumer to becoming a producer as well,
3) their decisions matter,
 	2) there are some problems to be solved to move to digital world - like huge money resources are required, different road obstacles which needs to be solved so the robo-vehicles can become fully autonomous like detours, proper infrastructure and vehicles’ communication, social attitude, other drivers’ behaviour and the unpredictability of this, fast reaction, smooth and undisturbed connection between all vehicles, road signs and road rules, hackers activitiy) controlled vs uncontrolled condition troubles (pre-defined roads as a first step), worse weather conditions

Also, an imporant part can also be the enemies the players need to fight against. One example can be the people who are against the changes and the creators’ era and want to stop them, like traditional cars’ manufacturers.  


**The main goal to achieve which needs to be clear for the user is to make a future, digital world the reality and keep their acheivements in a real life, so they can keep the feeling of being creators** 

### Characters
1. Main player - you
1. A Robo-vehicle
2. Matt  - an AI developer, which helps in building a new world.
3. People you cooperate with
3. Enemies - they aren’t open to any changes and put different obstacles on your road you need to fight against

### Plot


As a player you live a calm, daily, yer a bit boring life, but one day you received an email that destroyed your peace, and you’ve found out that you had been chosen to participate in rebuilding a world to be fully digital. Although you feel a bit tired and seems to be out of your creativity and energy you can’t refuse. Through messages being sent to your inbox you are being guided through different challenges in various districts of the city, and supported by a robo vehicle, and a AI developer. 
Day by day, you move forward, but don’t think that all will go smoothly. The are many enemies who want to keep the world as it is, so they annhilate your efforts, and you need to always be one step before them. The game is finished once you solved all of them and defeat all enemies, on your rebuidling road, which represent those who are againt changes.

To sum up:

the player builds the city infrastructure 
the player solves daily challenges which can help them to move forward and make people familiar with the power of the technology
the player solves the riddles to move forward and achieve next level

### Define the game’s type and provide core gameplay instruction, and a key aspect must contain how to customize robo-vehicle (NEV).


A role-playing game, but a casual game-play, so each action need to be separated and easy to do druing the break (and it has to move the user forward)

A player (a robo-vehicle) which cooperates with a AI developer in rebuilding current cities to become a fully digitable and modern. 

The main idea is to present all possible customizations of the robo-vehicle and design the missions it needs to take accordingly. Each feature (a setting) it can take should match to the task/mission it needs to complete (eg. to take packages from point A to point B a robo-vehicle needs to prepare an extra space on board, so it need to evolve in this way). Also make a traps from the real obstacles AI experience on its way to be fully used in everyday life. 

To get features to complete missions a player needs money (special tokens) that they can earn by engaging into refactoring the cities, so to make them robo/AI - friendly, and also by doing missions. Some can be even received as drop. Also the missions’ difficulty evolves step by step, so the first missions are possible to be taken without any special settings, while the upcoming has their requirements.


**Core play instruction**

**Title of game**
A Land road to an AI - Land

**Requiremets**
Casual- mobile game for a single user, but can join share with friends to double efforts


**Objective**
Rebuild your city to become fully digitable, defend your enemies, collect tokens, modify your car to do tasks and feel your creating power and keep your achievements

**Components**
A robo vehicle with a panel settings

**Setup**
No special setup is required


**How to play**

The game is played in a series of rounds taken place in different parts of the city. During each round which is  players are supposed to build a digital infrastructure, do daily tasks and defend their opponents by solving riddles or overcoming on the traps. Rounds’ are set in order and their complexity increased and some tasks in a round are also blocked until the player has enough tokens collected. 

**Player’s actions**

solve logical riddles
overcome road traps
fight enemies which want to stop you in a different way 
customise your robo-vehicle and earn tokens on this
connect with AI developer

**End of round**

Player is rewared by recieving a defined amount of tokens which can be spent on robo-vehicle customisations so to move forward and be accepted to the next round

**End of the game**

A game is completed when once the player completed all rounds (so finished all given tasks)



### Describe its genre conventions and define its concept art style using moodboard. It must contain a garage as its key scenario.

The main are is a modern-looking, digital city. Both people and the robots on the street.  Light colors, modern design.

**Art** (should match the vehicle project and be easy and basic enough to be able to be used on mobile devices) 
a city view (roads, crossroads, traffic, etc)
citiziens’ house view
a garage with a AI-human station
deauto included
colors and shapes should match deauto.io design 
2 hamburger menus on two sides? one to open panel settings on demand (seetings to customize deauto.io) the second (phone icon) connect with Matt - AI developer
GUI mock-up simulation
Map view so we can check the daily plan

### Provide a feasibility analysis report on persona, marketing, and gameplay research.

### Persona

### Gameplay research
https://forms.gle/VviZecQip3472ymXA 

### Marketing

1. create a new tab on deauto.io page for a game
2. via FB, Twitter and Instagram fanpage
3. game industry platforms
4. discord channels for players

### Besides, submit a development plan based on your feasibility analysis, including the development cycle, personnel, cost, and other development plans that may support.
 
**Development cycle**
1. Requirement analysis
two or one platform, native solution or cross-platform: according to latest survey around 70% of mobiles use Android, so it would be more beneficial to start from this system, so Kotlin or Java as a base 
2. Planning
3. Software design such as architectural design
4. Software development
5. Testing
6. Deployment
 
 
You can continue to optimize your proposal by getting feedback from other participants/challenges. Must submit your WIP material EVERY Monday to support participants in the other challenges.
