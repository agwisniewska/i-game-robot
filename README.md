# I, Game & Robot - *Last battle in the AiLand*

  

## Create its background, theme, narrative framework, concept, characters, plots, etc.

  

### Background

### New, modern, digital city of the future called AILand, with robo-vehicles, robots and people live together and able to communicate.

### Theme

  

revolves around autonomous devices and old-fashion cars companies that are reluctant to change and do their best to persuade people that autonomous cars are not more than a sophisticated trend and because AI is not smart enough it puts the people who use them in danger, in other words, there are problems they cannot solve

  

### Narrative Framework

  

It’s a story being told to the player, who is both a robo-vehicle and a programmer. So a player knows what is current task but has to react to the events on the road at a time. Some of them are solvable via custom configurations available to be set via setting panel, but some make the robo-vehicle not know what to do. So while the end of the mission is uknown because it depends how both robo-vehicle and a programmer solve their challenges, but the player is definietely being guided through the game.

  

### Concept

A digital, modern city called AiLand. IoT and smart houses are already there while drones deliver post and groceries to every house. Robots and people co-live togethe, and recently the autonomyous robo-vehicles joined the party. But not everyone has come to terms with the changes, and the old world is making itself felt.

  

Despite many tests being done, traditional car manufacturers are still trying to prove that there are obstacles that autonomous cars cannot overcome and are therefore dangerous to humans.

  

As a player, you are the epitome of a robo-vehicle and embark on all sorts of journeys. On one mission you transport a family with a toddler on vacation, in another you transport an organ for transplant to the hospital, in another you take a rock star to a concert, and in another you take an elderly lady to an afternoon pottery class.

  

These are just examples but none of them would be a peaceful trip. You need to be constantly focused, modify yourself and update your setting accordingly to what is happening on the road, and sometimes when you’re in trouble and you cannot understand what’s going on you call to your friend (or the second you) - Matt, AI Developer, who needs to solve and implement what you don’t know yet.

  

### Characters

1.  Robo-vehicle - you, the chairman of the transport in the city
    
2.  Matt - an AI developer (also you). He spends his days in a garage and keep in continous touch with you (robo vehicle) trying to fix any holes in a code regarding the experience and teach you the things you don’t know yet.
    
3.  Josepf - cars’ manufactory owner. He manages the team of people who target to set traps that an autonomous car cannot cope with
    

  

### Plots

  

#### Plot 1

  
  

#### Plot 2

  

#### Plot 3

  

#### Plot 4

  

## Define the game’s type and provide core gameplay instruction, and a key aspect must contain how to customize robo-vehicle (NEV).

  
  

A role-playing game

To complete each task you need to customize your robo-vehicle. Because you don’t know what to expect you can’t do it in advance but you have to modify some of your features while on road (like wheels, an engine, windows, wipers, doors, 4x4 drive, a bumper and so on)

But the evil cars’ manufactury is trying to deceive you and provoke a situation you may not be prepared for. There could be different examples like spilled oil on the street, an animal running out of the way, unexpected change of direction of movement, switching off currents etc. In that case you need to contact Matt quickly hoping that he solves a riddle before time ends.

  

## Describe its genre conventions and define its concept art style using moodboard. It must contain a garage as its key scenario.

  

The main are is a modern-looking, digital city. Both people and the robots on the street. Drones flying in the air. Light colors, modern design.

  

## Provide a feasibility analysis report on persona, marketing, and gameplay research.

  

## Besides, submit a development plan based on your feasibility analysis, including the development cycle, personnel, cost, and other development plans that may support.

  
You can continue to optimize your proposal by getting feedback from other participants/challenges. Must submit your WIP material EVERY Monday to support participants in the other challenges.
