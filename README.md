# I, Game & Robot

## Create its background, theme, narrative framework, concept, characters, plots, etc.

### Background

New, modern, digital city of the future. The times when the history ended. All goes well only a transport guy has many to do each they.

### Theme

In essence, the central theme of The I, Game & Robot resolves around a good and a bad and the ability to find truth and care all habitants' well-being.

### Narrative Framework

It’s a story being told to the player. So both a player knows what happens and can analyse on their own but also can talk to other players and receive some clues what to do next. The whole story is partially determined, as the player is being guided by the plots, but also they can choose choose the actions they want to complete of how they want to behave

### Concept

You’re Leo. You live in a modern, clean and a happy city of future called Fakelan. It seems like the history has ended and nothing ever will destroy it. Or at least it’s how the habitants see it, but as you are in charge of transport each day you wake up you see that you’re only a step away from the disaster. It’s because you’re in charge of the transport, many need your help to work smoothly so you need to do your daily task.

As a result, you pick up workers to their offices, children to school, a food to the stores or sick people to the hospital, otherwise the sick will die, the employeers become unemployed and end up on the street or people will get sick or suffer from food shortages. A huge responsability, huh? But you don’t complain, you’re happy to help them all and keep this world in a good condition.

Of course you experience some troubles on the road and you have to race against the time many times, but you have two things supporting you, not only an unique and only the one on the world vehicle which can transform freely to provide you with new features, but also many random people, friends from the city, who help you to complete your daily mission. When you (or you mechanic does it for you) modify your vehicle’s features you become the owner of them and can sell them on the marketplace to other users (you’ll receive a creator fee anytime someone buys the element you created) The same applies to the whole vehicle’s (you can tokenize it and share with other users)

So to keep everything healthy and in a good condition you need to do your daily tasks, but one day you find out no matter that you completed all tasks successfuly yesterday (which basically means all is good) all patients of Sun Hospital died. The next day you encountered that the same happened to another district which you provided with the food the previous day. You have no idea what happened, but out of sudden you bumped into a weird-looking spiritual guy called Kikoot, who says that some of your friends are enemies who want to destroy the city and kill all the people and you have to eliminate them before they finish their plan first.

He says that it’s possible to identify them because there are some differences in eg. their voice, apperance or behaviour, but you need to augment your abilities because at first sight all look normal and seem to be friendly. And to gain those skills you need to be careful on your way and very open-minded. Soon you realise, that even if you uncover their secret they still don’t want to give up and became very unfriendly, so you need to be prepared for a fight. Will they also still be the humans?

So from one hand since then you need to continue your daily jobs so to keep the healthy city (and of course overcome all standard obstacles on your way) and trust people, because you won’t do everything on your own, but on the other hand you don’t know how to find out the truth, indentify and eliminate the enemies.

So, you try to get new abilites and save the city, but your enemies doesn’t stop their devil plans. It’s your race against the time. Will truth and a good people win and you save the city?

### Plots

#### Plot 1

It’s a first day of the story. You wake up, you receive a list of tasks to complete, and a time allocated. You get the car ready and you start your mission. You have some troubles on your way so you need to modify your vehicle a bit and also prepare it properly to the upcoming tasks but in general all goes smothly. You meet many friendly people on your road ready to help you to finish your tasks. Finally you end up the first day with all marks checked.

#### Plot 2

You are waken up by your secretary screaming that all patiens of the Sun Hospital died the last night, and you must have missed to deliver the medicaments to them on time. You are almost sure you did, but you double check and indeed, the blockchain’s record says that you did it. You are worried, not sure what happened, but you already lost some time, while the new day’s list is still valid and you cannot let something bad happen again. So you prepare your car and you leave. Like the day before you meet many friendly people and all seem to go well. But after a while you receive another phone call with a message that once you left a food in the zoo, all animals who ate it during the lunch died. You don’t understand how it could have happened, but as it’s the end of the day, you go home.

At the traffic lights just before your home, you notice a hunched old man walking on the pedestrian crossing. He stops, looks at you, and explains you that not everything is the same as it seems to be and you have to watch out and have your eyes wide open and gain some skills to be able to differentiate the truth and the lies. Then, very quickly he disappears.

#### Plot 3

You start another day, this time you’re not so optimistic and you decide to solve the riddle following the advice of an elderly man you met the evening before. So you look round carefully looking for any clue which may help also how you can gain the new abilites (super powers) and that’s how step by step you start uncovering the truth, and start eliminating bad characters from your city. And fix what they managed to destroy. And still do your daily tasks as before. All the fight happen somehow behind the scene as the the ignorant inhabitants don't know that they are in great danger, and you don't want to destroy their peaceful life.

#### Plot 4

Your enemy is a huge fear as they realise that your abilites to uncover them increased. So they decide to double their efforts and prepare for a final race with you. So now it’s your turn to gather all you learned, all your extra features, and all who are by your side and stand to the final fight. Will you save the city?

## Define the game’s type and provide core gameplay instruction, and a key aspect must contain how to customize robo-vehicle (NEV).

role-playing game

To complete each task you need to customize your robo-vehicle. But luckily you have your car magician which will adapt your car to any task you have and as a plus he does it even remotely.

So even if he spends most of his time in his favourite old-fashioned garage where you need to leave your car by night in this modern city everything is digital and managed via smart devices, so even your car features’ are updated remotely. Just give a call and tell what you need. One thing you need to remember, though, is that you need to always have your tokens(money) ready to be sent. Although, your mechanic is the only trustworthy person in this city, he is a horrible miser, and he doesn’t do anything if your digital wallet is empty.

  
## Describe its genre conventions and define its concept art style using moodboard. It must contain a garage as its key scenario.


The main are is a modern-looking, digital city. Both people and the robots on the street. Drones flying in the air. Light colors, modern design, peaceful areas. And so-called black holes/cementaries - the areas which have became polluted by your enemies. A garage where your fancy car stationates and your good friend (and a magic-hands car's mechanic) spend his days. 


## Provide a feasibility analysis report on persona, marketing, and gameplay research.

  

## Besides, submit a development plan based on your feasibility analysis, including the development cycle, personnel, cost, and other development plans that may support.

  

You can continue to optimize your proposal by getting feedback from other participants/challenges. Must submit your WIP material EVERY Monday to support participants in the other challenges.
